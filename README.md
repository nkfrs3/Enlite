# Introduction  

Hello reader. I created this project, Enlite, as a personal portfolio project while attending App Academy. Enlite is modeled after the existing site [untappd](https://untappd.com/home). Untappd is a a place for beer lovers to find and rate beers. Enlite serves a similar purpose but is geared towards coffee drinkers. It allows visitors to view information about coffee shops in the State of Ohio. They can leave a review and check in at each location. 

# Technologies Used

The main technologies I used to build out Enlite were Express, postgres with Sequelize, React with Redux, and CSS. The site can be accessed through the live link hosted on [heroku](http:www.google.com).
